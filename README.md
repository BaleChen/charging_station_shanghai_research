# Spatial Equity Analysis of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: A Case Study of Shanghai, China

This is a lab research project led by Bale Chen (bale.chen[@]nyu.edu) and mentored by Professor Chenghe Guan and Jialin Liu. This project is conducted in and supported by the Key Lab of Urban Design and Science at New York University Shanghai.

This isn't a fully finished project. If you are interested, feel free to reach out via email.

## Description

This research project attempts to use a tailored version of Improved Gravity Model of Accessibility on a pixel-level and regression analysis to examine the spatial equity of public electric vehicle charging stations (PEVCSs) in the context of Shanghai, China. Its main contributions can be summarized by

* Developed a novel and easy-to-implement version of Improved Gravity Model that is tailored to calculating the accessibility of PEVCSs, capturing the travel cost, PEVCS service capacity, and charging demand in a more integrated way.
* Proposed a framework for the spatial equity analysis on a pixel level that can reflect the spatial equity of each general piece of land in a city with all the data sourced from publicly available platforms.
* Qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed the PEVCS accessibility in Shanghai from a perspective of spatial equity.
